lexical structure 

The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elementary
rules that specifies you how to write programs. It states what variables look like,how comments are written,keywords etc.

Text of javascript program 
javascript is a case sensitive language which means "abc" and "ABC" are
treated as different.
javascript ignores spaces between tokens.
javascript also ignores line breaks as well for the most part but there are 
some exception you will see later in this article.
because you can use spaces and new lines freely in your program you can format 
and indent your program in a neat way and consistent way which makes the code easy to understand.
